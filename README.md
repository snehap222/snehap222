ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone!!

I am currently enrolled at the University of Maryland as a computer science major. It's been really exciting moving to a new state and meeting people from all over the world on campus! I especially appreciate the opportunities I've been given to explore the reaches of computer science here at university.

I have always been interested in integrating my interest in recreation with my passion for computer science, and I am continuing to work towards that goal as I delve into the world of software development. I hope to combine my skills in programming, drawing, and creative development to create and publish software on an online platform.

I am also really interesting in exploring new areas of technological development such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and more as I progress on my journey as a computer scientist. I especially enjoy challenges as they motivate me to learn and apply new skills to my everyday life, making me open to any new opportunities that come my way!
